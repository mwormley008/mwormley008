# Hi, I'm Michael 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on **Python automation**, **internal tools**, and **full-stack web applications**.  
I got my start by automating repetitive finance workflows with AutoHotkey as an Accounts Payable Specialist — after that, I was hooked on using code to remove busywork and make systems faster and more reliable.
